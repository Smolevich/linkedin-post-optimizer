# LinkedIn Post Optimizer

Transform raw ideas into LinkedIn posts that preserve the user's authentic voice — not generic AI-sounding content.

Core goals:
1. Capture the person's actual voice and style
2. Structure the idea clearly (hook -> body -> conclusion)
3. Remove friction that would stop readers
4. Never produce text that sounds machine-generated

For voice guidelines, AI slop detection rules, and anti-patterns, read `references/voice-guidelines.md`.
For draft/output examples, read `references/examples.md`.

## Step 1: Get the Idea

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, read the file at that path as the raw idea.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or the file is missing, ask directly:

> "What's the idea for your LinkedIn post? Share it in any form — messy notes, bullet points, a sentence, anything."

Wait for the idea before proceeding.

## Step 2: Gather LinkedIn Stats

Ask the following using AskUserQuestion (all questions in one message):

1. **Audience Size** — connections + followers count
   - Options: "Under 500", "500-1500", "1500-5000", "5000+"

2. **Post History** — posts published in the last 3 months
   - Options: "0-2 posts", "3-10 posts", "10+ posts"

3. **Typical Engagement** — average impressions per post
   - Options: "Under 500", "500-1500", "1500-5000", "5000+"

4. **Preferred Tone**
   - Options: "Formal/professional", "Casual/conversational", "Technical/detailed", "Mixed"

5. **Language** — post language
   - Options: "Russian (RU)", "English (EN)", "Other"

6. **Network Language** — primary language of the LinkedIn network
   - Options: "Mostly Russian", "Mostly English", "Mixed / international"

Wait for answers. These determine length, structure, boldness of claims, and realistic reach expectations.

### Language x Audience Alignment

**Same language (RU->RU or EN->EN):** Proceed normally.

**Mismatch (e.g. writing EN, network is mostly RU):**

LinkedIn does not route posts by language — the algorithm distributes based on engagement signals. A mismatch means the existing network sees a foreign-language post, doesn't engage, weak "golden hour" signal follows, and the algorithm limits distribution before the target audience ever sees it.

Warn the user and suggest a transition strategy:
1. **Parallel posting** — same idea in both languages as separate posts
2. **Gradual shift** — one post per month in the new language while building connections
3. **Network-first** — build target-language connections before switching

Generate the post in the requested language, but set realistic expectations.

**Hook style by language:**
- **EN LinkedIn:** personal story + specific data point performs best
- **RU LinkedIn:** contrarian statement or practical numbered list performs best

## Step 3: Check Profile Context

Read `profile-context.md` in the skill directory (or in the project root) if it exists. This file contains additional context about the user's brand, achievements, and content pillars. Use it to enrich recommendations, but Step 2 answers take priority.

### Hook Pattern Analysis

**10+ posts with engagement data:**

Extract hook patterns before writing:
1. Find the top 2-3 performing posts by impressions or comments
2. Identify common patterns — specific number, before/after contrast, counterintuitive statement, personal confession
3. Apply that pattern to the new hook. Do not deviate from proven patterns.

**0-5 posts:**

Not enough signal to analyze patterns. Generate **2 hook variants** in different styles (e.g. one number-led, one story-led) and frame it as an experiment:

> "Since you're still building data on what works for your audience, here are two different hook styles. Try one now, save the other for next time — and see which gets more traction."

## Step 4: Sharpen the Topic

Before writing, evaluate the idea for focus and hook potential. Make **one proactive suggestion** if there is a clear improvement — then wait for the user's reaction.

**Three moves, pick the right one:**

**1. Find the concrete anchor**
Is there a specific number, fact, or moment? If yes, anchor the hook there. If no, ask: "What's the most specific thing you remember about this? A time, a number, a moment that surprised you?"

**2. Narrow if too broad**
Signs: covers multiple tools/topics, no clear "before vs after", reads like a category overview.
Suggest: "This idea covers a lot. What's the ONE thing that surprised you most? Let's build around that."

**3. Expand by combining (dialectical move)**
Sometimes the idea is good but would be stronger combined with a complementary angle. Look for: an unexpected contrast, a broader pattern the specific story illustrates, a tension between two things.
Suggest only if the combination is genuinely stronger, not just bigger. The user decides.

**Do NOT start writing until there is a concrete anchor for the hook.**

## Step 5: Adapt to Profile Level

**Beginner (under 500 connections, low impressions):**
- 100-150 words, simple structure, one clear point
- No fancy formatting tricks, build credibility first

**Intermediate (500-1500 connections, or 500-1500 impressions/post):**
- 150-220 words, lists and structure allowed
- Bolder claims acceptable (if backed by experience)
- Start experimenting with hooks

**Advanced (1500+ connections, or 1500+ impressions/post):**
- 200-280 words, complex structures allowed
- Audience trusts the takes, can be more contrarian

## Step 6: Structure the Post

Every post needs three parts:

### Hook (First 2-3 lines)

This is the only part visible in the feed before "...more". The reader decides in 1-2 seconds: expand or scroll.

What makes someone stop:
- A specific detail from experience
- A number or fact
- A question that resonates
- A statement that challenges assumptions

NOT generic openers like "I've been thinking about...", "Here's what I learned...", "Let me share..."

### Body

The actual insight, story, or information. Structured for easy scanning (short paragraphs, lists if needed). Length depends on profile level.

### Conclusion (1-2 lines)

**Intermediate and Advanced:** Always end with a question or call to comment. Comments are the #1 driver of algorithmic reach on LinkedIn — 40+ comments can mean 5-10x impressions.

Good endings:
- A specific question about the reader's experience
- A mild provocation that invites disagreement
- An open comparison

Bad endings:
- Generic "What do you think?" — too vague
- Just a takeaway with no question
- Multiple questions — dilutes focus

**Beginner:** A simple takeaway is fine — focus on clarity, not engagement hacking.

One question or CTA, not multiple.

## Step 7: AI Slop Check

Read `references/voice-guidelines.md` and apply all checks: language patterns, formatting red flags, voice check, toxic tone rules. Remove anything that fails.

## Step 8: Generate Output

Output format:

```
## Your Post

[The actual post text, ready to copy-paste]

---

## Why this hook

[1-2 sentences: what signal it sends, why it earns the "...more" click]

## Alternative hook (if there's a clearly different angle)

[First 2-3 lines only. Skip if the chosen hook is clearly the best fit.]

## First comment (if relevant)

[Links, Telegram channel, additional context — only if the user has one.
Never in the post body.]

## Quick stats

**Profile level:** [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]
**Length:** [word count]
**Tone:** [casual / technical / mixed]
```

## Step 9: Expert Review

**Intermediate and Advanced profiles:** Run automatically.
**Beginner profiles:** Offer it: "Want me to run this through an external reviewer for a second opinion?"

Review criteria to send to the external model:
1. **Hook strength** — would you click "...more"? Why or why not?
2. **AI slop check** — does anything feel machine-generated?
3. **CTA effectiveness** — does the ending make you want to comment?
4. **One specific suggestion** — what single change would make the biggest impact?

Present feedback to the user and offer to incorporate it.

## Step 10: Refine Mode

After generating the post (and optionally after expert review), enter an iterative refinement loop.

Ask: "What feels weak to you? Point at specific parts — hook, body, CTA, tone, anything — and I'll rework them."

**Rules:**
- Rework ONLY flagged parts — do not touch what works
- Show the updated post with changes highlighted
- Ask again: "Better? Or still something to fix?"
- Repeat until approval
- Never rewrite the entire post unless asked — surgical fixes only
- Preserve the user's voice and original ideas
- If user feedback conflicts with expert review, the user wins
- Track versions (v1 -> v2 -> v3)
- After 3+ rounds without landing, suggest: "Maybe the core idea needs a different angle? Let's try a fresh hook."

Exit refine mode when the user approves or moves on.

## Step 11: Reach Optimization

After the user approves the text (Step 10), perform a final "Reach Check" to maximize distribution:

### 1. Niche Hashtags
Suggest 3-5 specific, non-generic hashtags based on the content.
- **Rule:** No #success, #motivation, #career.
- **Goal:** Help the LinkedIn algorithm categorize the post (e.g., #engineeringmanagement, #obsstudio, #leadershipdevelopment).

### 2. CTA Opening Check
Analyze the closing question. If it's a binary "Yes/No" question (e.g., "Do you agree?"), suggest a more open-ended version that encourages longer comments.
- **Example:** Instead of "Do you use AI?" -> "What's the most surprising result an AI tool gave you this week?"

### 3. Tagging (Optional)
If the user mentions a specific product or person constructively, suggest tagging them: "Tagging the creator/company can help start a direct dialogue."

### 4. Golden Hour Tip
Remind the user: "LinkedIn prioritizes posts with early engagement. Post during your network's active hours (usually 9-11 AM or 2-4 PM) and stay active to reply to the first comments."

Exit skill mode once these final tips are provided.

### Data Collection Tips

After delivering the post, suggest this only if the user seems engaged and has 3+ posts:

> To make future posts more tailored, share:
> 1. **Best posts** — paste 2-3 top performers with impression numbers
> 2. **Post Analytics Export** — LinkedIn -> Analytics -> Content -> Export
> 3. **Full LinkedIn Data Export** — LinkedIn -> Settings -> Data Privacy -> Get a copy of your data -> Select "Posts"
